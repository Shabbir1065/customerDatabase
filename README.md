# Customer Database RESTful API
This is an API that I built using the Spring Boot and wrote it in Java. Spring Boot is a technology that helps developers to create applications that can run without a webserver. The goal of this project was to help me learn more about API's, the REST architecture, how to use a PostgreSQL database, and to see how a company may want to organize customer data.

# Testing endpoints in Postman
Postman is an application that helps users test their API's. I used it here to test the various methods that I have (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
