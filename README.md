# customerDatabase
This is an API that I built using the Spring Boot and wrote it in Java. The goal of this project was to help me learn more about API's and to see how a

# Testing endpoints in Postman
Postman is an application that helps users test their API's. I used it here to test the various methods that I have (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
